# rmalloc

- A simple memory allocator exhibiting the similar behavior of the official malloc().
- Coalescing is implemented.
- No free list is kept.

## Acknowledgements
- Hats off to Professor Chris Kanich for the clear explanation of how malloc() works in a general sense. I've learned all the theory from [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTii4dyhR5c).
